This is a collection of my personal dot files meant to help with setup. This is split up into Mac and Linux currently to help differentiate the two.

Shout out to MattKline13 for the excellent Mac interfaces.

Installation Instructions:
	Rename osVerify to ".bash_profile"
	Move ".bash_config" and ".bash+profile" to ~ 
	Reload shell

Needed improvements:
	1) Reduce size of files by combining shared commands of all systems into a single file to be run always
	2) Cygwin commands needed. Not a pressing issue as I rarely if ever use it.
